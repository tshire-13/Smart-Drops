# STATISTICS 

Out of the 47.4% national water loss (NRW), about 35% is physical water loss (mainly burst and leaking pipes, old infrastructure).

That translates into billions of liters lost every year. 
The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) estimates this costs municipalities roughly R7 billion annually from pipe leaks and bursts alone (excluding theft and billing inefficiencies)

## Why this matters

Aging infrastructure = the biggest driver of leaks. Many municipalities are deferring pipe replacement because of budget issues, leading to repeated bursts.

Water scarcity risk: South Africa is already classified as a “water-stressed country”; leaks from old pipes accelerate day-zero scenarios in metros.

Cost spiral: Every R1 not spent on preventative pipe maintenance can lead to R5–R10 in repair and water loss costs later.
