# STATISTICS 

Out of the 47.4% national water loss (NRW), about 35% is physical water loss (mainly burst and leaking pipes, old infrastructure).

That translates into billions of liters lost every year. The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) estimates this costs municipalities roughly R7 billion annually from pipe leaks and bursts alone (excluding theft and billing inefficiencies).

Much of South Africa’s water network is 40–100 years old, especially in big metros, making leaks inevitable without large-scale replacement.

## Examples by municipality

### eThekwini (Durban)

Roughly 50% of treated water is lost, mostly due to leaking, aging pipes.

Daily losses = R5 million per day → ~R1.8 billion/year just from infrastructure leaks.

### Matjhabeng (Free State)

56% of water supplied was lost in 2021/22 → ~R323 million lost, most due to decayed pipes and poor maintenance.

### City of Tshwane

Reports around 40% physical water losses, largely from old asbestos cement and steel pipelines that frequently burst.

Financial loss runs into hundreds of millions annually.

## Why this matters

Aging infrastructure = the biggest driver of leaks. Many municipalities are deferring pipe replacement because of budget issues, leading to repeated bursts.

Water scarcity risk: South Africa is already classified as a “water-stressed country”; leaks from old pipes accelerate day-zero scenarios in metros.

Cost spiral: Every R1 not spent on preventative pipe maintenance can lead to R5–R10 in repair and water loss costs later.
